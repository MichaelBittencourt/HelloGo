###### I can edit the path of a specific package ########

go mod edit -replace example.com/greetings=../greetings

#this will add something like this on go.mod
# module example.com/hello
#
# go 1.16
#
# replace example.com/greetings => ../greetings

#To update or get a specific version
# you can get from a specific commit hash tag version and I think, a branch
go get github.com/MichaelBittencourt/greatings@latest
